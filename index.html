              <br />
              Wembanyama scanned his surroundings, then paused. He’d just
              finished morning shootaround in one of the world’s most famous
              sporting venues. “Definitely incredible,” he said. “It’s not as
              big as I expected. But still, the vibe is here.” Wembanyama
              certainly played a role in bringing it later that night into a
              crowded arena filled with throngs of reporters following his every
              move. Too bad Wembanyama started as cold as the winds whipping
              across the Hudson. He connected on 4-of-14 shots for 14 points
              with nine rebounds and finished a team-worst minus-25. The rookie
              missed his first five attempts, hoisting two airballs along the
              way. He scored two points over the first two quarters, pouring in
              most of his points (eight) in the fourth. The 19-year-old wouldn’t
              connect on his first field goal until 3:18 remained in the third
              quarter. Wembanyama mentioned the Knicks defended him differently
              than opponents did in his previous seven outings with physicality
              serving as a hallmark. “We did have a rough start, collectively,”
              he said. “I think no matter how many times I’ll play here, it will
              always be special.”

              INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Utah Jazz will be without starting center
              Walker Kessler for at least the next two weeks because of an
              injured left elbow. Team officials made the announcement Wednesday
              before its game at Indiana. Kessler, a first-team all-rookie
              selection last season, was injured during a season-opening loss to
              the Sacramento Kings on Oct. 25. After initially trying to play
              through the pain, doctors determined he injured the ulnar
              collateral ligament and that the best remedy would be avoiding
              contact for two more weeks. Then he will be re-evaluated. He’s
              averaging 8.3 points and 7.9 rebounds. “We check in our players
              every day on how they’re feeling and it reached a level in the
              last day or so, it garnered a lot more attention,” coach Will
              Hardy. “Walker is not somebody who’s going to make excuses for his
              play. So I’m not going to do that, either. “You’re going to see
              some lineups that we haven’t seen yet. Obviously, starting a
              couple of guys who are going to be making their first starts of
              the year.”

                NBA Fantasy: Waiver Wire targets ahead of Week 4

              />
              <br />
              As Week 4 approaches, the injury bug is rearing its ugly head.
              Thirteen teams are playing four games in Week 4, and although we
              typically look there for streaming options, the injury scenarios
              provide opportunities for longer-term usage. We’ll identify
              low-rostered options for the upcoming week using data from Yahoo’s
              Fantasy Basketball platform. Skylar Mays, Portland Trail Blazers
              (95% available) At first glance, Mays looks like a slam-dunk
              option. Malcolm Brogdon (hamstring) was knocked out of Wednesday’s
              game, which allowed Mays extended time with Anfernee Simons
              (thumb) and Scoot Henderson (ankle) also sidelined. He responded
              with a solid 18-point, 11-assist result. I would qualify a Mays
              endorsement with one significant fact – Henderson should return by
              next week, and he is currently 65% rostered in all Yahoo leagues.
              If the rookie is still available, he’s the better long-term option
              in this scenario, but Mays should also be considered a
              stash-worthy guard. Duncan Robinson, Miami Heat (91% available)
              The Heat received some bad news this week, as Tyler Herro‘s injury
              on Wednesday was diagnosed as a Grade 2 ankle sprain that will
              knock him out of action for up to a month. Historical data tells
              us that Robinson was an apt fill-in last season when healthy, but
              with Josh Richardson on the roster, we may see more of a committee
              approach during Herro’s absence. Despite Richardson’s presence, I
              still prefer Robinson as the better long-term option. Keyonte
              George, Utah Jazz (85% available) It might be too soon to tell,
              but with Talen Horton-Tucker struggling, the Jazz started George
              in the backcourt Wednesday night, and the rookie responded with
              nine assists. While one game doesn’t represent a changing of the
              guard, it’s an encouraging sign for the Baylor product, who has
              multiple avenues for increased usage. Jordan Clarkson has also
              failed to get going through the first three weeks of the season,
              so we could see more of George at either backcourt position if the
              struggles continue. Rui Hachimura, Los Angeles Lakers (81%
              available) While I can see a reason to add Christian Wood (63%
              available), I’m a bigger fan of Hachimura, who is finally out of
              the concussion protocol. Anthony Davis‘ groin injury was a minor
              issue, prompting a collective sigh of relief from Lakers fans. I
              imagine it also woke up some of the coaching staff, and it
              wouldn’t be a surprise to see Davis’ playing time managed more
              closely. With Davis sidelined Wednesday night, Hachimura turned in
              an impressive 24 points and eight rebounds across 26 minutes.
              Things will shake up again when Jarred Vanderbilt (heel) makes his
              season debut, but Hachimura is my favorite option in LA’s second
              unit right now. Santi Aldama, Memphis Grizzlies (81% available)
              The Grizzlies have been hit hard with injuries to its frontcourt.
              Steven Adams (knee) and Brandon Clarke (Achilles) are long-term
              absences, and to make matters worse, Xavier Tillman is saddled
              with a knee injury. Aldama made his season debut last weekend and
              is already making an impact as a rebounder. Bismack Biyombo has
              started in Tillman’s place, but Aldama will also see time at the
              five and also provide backup support for Jaren Jackson, who is
              definitely overworked. Dorian Finney-Smith, Brooklyn Nets (54%
              available) Ben Simmons (hip), Cam Thomas (ankle) and Nic Claxton
              (ankle) are all sidelined, and although I considered Royce O’Neale
              as a potential add, Finney-Smith is showing flashes of production.
              The versatile multi-position player has scored in single-digits
              only once this season, and he’s having the best start of his
              career beyond the arc. Over eight games, he’s averaging a
              career-high 7.5 three-point attempts with a conversion rate of 45
              percent.

              The schedule Friday gave us the second night of In-Season
              Tournament group-play games. For a lot of NBA teams, though, it
              gave them their first exposure to the concept. Here are some
              players’ and coaches’ initial thoughts about their debuts this
              week or last: LeBron James, Lakers: It feels great because it’s an
              In-Season Tournament win. And we’ll take that, we’ll take that for
              sure. There’s $500,000 [per player prize money] on the line – so
              we’re goin’ for that. We’re goin’ for that. Luka Doncic,
              Mavericks: Every game matters, especially in the In-Season
              Tournament. … You’ve got to win every game possible. Keegan
              Murray, Kings: The games are competitive early on. We’re in week 2
              or 3 and we already have kind of a playoff-like atmosphere.
              Stephen Curry, Warriors: A lot of competitiveness. I think
              everybody is trying to get off to a good start during the year
              with the In-Season Tournament vibe, the court change and all that
              added a little energy to it. Draymond Green, Warriors: We talk
              about this In-Season Tournament, and it’s a playoff game. It was a
              fun game to play in. The intensity level was there. So, job well
              done to the NBA. Tyrese Haliburton, Pacers: I thought it was fire.
              I loved the [court] color. It feels like I’m in [NBA] 2K out
              there. Jalen Suggs, Magic: It really feels like we’re playing in
              the [soccer] Champions League. Duncan Robinson, Heat: It’s big [to
              start 1-0]. No one in the history of the In-Season Tournament has
              ever lost their first game and won the tournament. So it was huge
              to get that first one. Jaylen Brown, Celtics: I wouldn’t choose
              the word excited, but ready. … If there’s basketball to be played,
              our group will be ready.” Coach Steve Clifford, Hornets: For our
              fan base and everybody, it’s not part of what we are used to,
              where again, if you watch European soccer, it’s a big part of what
              they do. So our guys, a lot of the reason these guys are here is
              because they are the best competitors and it’s another opportunity
              to compete. And I do think the single-elimination thing can be an
              exciting dynamic as people get used to it. Coach Gregg Popovich,
              Spurs: I think the fans are the ones that are more excited than we
              are. It gives them a lot of things to talk about. It’s kind of a
              portent of maybe who’s going to be there at the end of the year,
              and they can talk about that. I think it will be a heightened
              competitive environment amongst the players for sure. Coach Mike
              Brown, Kings: I think it’s kind of neat, y’know? … I’m excited
              that I’m able to be a part of the NBA to experience something new
              like this. We talked to our guys about it, we talked to them about
              the point differential [as tiebreaker]. We were getting our heads
              smashed in in Houston, they held the ball at the end of the game
              and took a shot-clock violation. Well, when it comes to the
              in-season tournament, you can’t do that. On either side, if you’re
              up or you’re down.
